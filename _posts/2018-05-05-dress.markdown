# Cultural Appropriation?
Unless you intentionally mock the culture, it's not. Everything every culture 
has made was likely derived from multiple cultures. We've been "sharing" with
each other since the our first ancestor went across the river or over the next
hill, met another group of people, made an exchange, and incorporated whatever
idea or good he/she got into his/her own group. Let's not stunt humanity's 
growth.
